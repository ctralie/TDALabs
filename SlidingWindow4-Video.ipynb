However, even though there are <code>WH</code> pixels in each frame, there are only <code>N</code> frames in the video.  This means that each frame in the video can be represented in an <code>(N-1)</code> dimensional subspace of the pixel space, and the coordinates of this subspace can be used in lieu of the pixels in the sliding window embedding.  This can be done efficiently with a PCA step before the sliding window embedding.  Run the cell below to load code that does PCA efficiently"
